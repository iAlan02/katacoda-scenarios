# We'll start cloning a project repository

## Task

We'll be cloning an empty project.

Note that in this case we are using a different directory as remote repository, but we can host our projects over GitLab or Github, replacing the path with the URL of the project repository.

First lets to see we are over an empty directory.
`ls`{{execute}}

Now let's clone an existing repository.
`git clone /home/scrapbook/tutorial/git/my-remote/project`{{execute}}

We can see that there's now a folder with the cloned project.
`ls`{{execute}}
