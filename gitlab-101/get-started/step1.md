We will clone a project repository.

## Task

We'll be cloning an empty project named _exercise_.

First lets run `ls`{{execute}} to see we are over an empty directory.

Now let's clone an existing repository using the following command:

`git clone https://gitlab.com/git1011/exercise`{{execute}}

If we run `ls`{{execute}} we can see that there's now a folder with the cloned project.
