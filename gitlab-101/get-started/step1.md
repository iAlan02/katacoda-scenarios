We will clone a project repository.

## Task

We'll be cloning an empty project.

First lets run `ls`{{execute}} to see we are over an empty directory.

Now let's clone an existing repository using `git clone /home/scrapbook/tutorial/git/my-remote/project`{{execute}}

Note that in this case we are using a different directory as remote repository, but we can host our projects over GitLab or Github, replacing the path with the URL of the project repository.

If we run `ls`{{execute}} we can see that there's now a folder with the cloned project.
