Now we'll create a new file inside our project folder

## Task

First we need to navigate inside the project folder with `cd exercise`{{execute}}.

Then we'll create a new file with the command `touch new-file`{{execute}}.

If we run `git status`{{execute}} we can see that the new file untracked in the repository.

Git recognizes that we0ve created a new file, but it is currently untracked and git doesn't know about it.
