Now we'll create a new file inside our project folder

## Task

We need to navigate inside the project folder.
`cd exercise`{{execute}}

Then we'll create a new file, feel free to add any number of files.
`touch new-file`{{execute}}

We can see that the new file untracked in the repository.
`git status`{{execute}}

Git recognizes that we've created a new file, but it is currently untracked and git doesn't know about it.
