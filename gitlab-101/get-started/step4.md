When we have something in the staging area, git recognizes that there's something to be commited.

## Task

We can commit the file now using a meaningful commit message with `git commit -m "Adding in a test file"`{{execute}}.

If we run `git status`{{execute}} again it will show that there's nothing more to commit.
