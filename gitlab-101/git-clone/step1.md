We will clone a project repository.

## Task

This is an _example_ of cloning a GitLab project running **clone command**.

First lets run `ls`{{execute}} to see we are over an empty directory.

Now lets clone an existing repository using the following command:

`git clone https://gitlab.com/RUCA93/exercise`{{execute}}

If we run `ls ./exercise`{{execute}} we can see that there's now a folder with the cloned project
and inside of that folder there's a **README.md** file already created.
