# It's time to run the container

For it we just need to run `docker run -d --name my-api -p 3000:3000 my-api-xample`{{exec}}

Where in the flag **--name** we are indicating the name of the container, under **-p** we are publishing the port of the container with the port of the host machine, and at the end we indicates the tag of the image we builded before. The flag **d** runs the container in the background and at the end prints the container ID.

If we do `curl http://localhost:3000/state/getall`{{exec}} we'll get all MÃ©xico states, that means our docker container is running correctly and we are able to communicate with the api!
