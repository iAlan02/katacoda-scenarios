Installing Terraform and CDKTF

## Task

Since we'll be using CDKTF, as you can suspect, we need to install Terraform first in order to be able to use it
So lets execute the following commands in our terminal

```
brew tap hashicorp/tap
brew install hashicorp/tap/terraform
```{{exec}}

And now let's install the client for CDKTF

`npm install --global cdktf-cli@latest`{{exec}}
